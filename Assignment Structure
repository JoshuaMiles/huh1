Technical Description


Problems
Problems with accessing the Tanda api
    What I ended up doing


The async nature of javascript
    Sacrafices and the things I learnt about promises

Google Oauth
    Original plan needed to be scrapped because I couldnt handle the oauth requests in a reasonable amount of time
